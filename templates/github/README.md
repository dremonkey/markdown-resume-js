# Github Theme for Markdown-Resume-JS

This is a Github inspired resume theme. It uses gulp to automatically compile less and livereload the browser when files change.

## Getting Started
1. Run ```$ npm install``` to install all node dependencies
2. Run ```$ gulp serve --resume resumes/resume.html``` to start the server and tell grunt which file to load. The resumes directory should be at the top level of markdown-resume-js. If it is not, create it and put your resume files in there.

## Dependencies
- [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
